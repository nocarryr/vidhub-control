## Overview
Interface with Videohub SDI Matrix Switchers by [Blackmagic Design](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/).

The primary purpose is for use as a library in other applications, but a minimal
application is included (still a work in progress).

Since neither the devices nor the software for them support presets or macros,
a need arose for instantaneous multiple routing changes.  This, as well as
setting the names for inputs and outputs within a single application can be
accomplished using this project.
